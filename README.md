# R implementation for mzTab-M
[![Build Status](https://github.com/lifs-tools/rmzTab-m/actions/workflows/check-standard.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lifs-tools/rmzTab-m/actions/workflows/check-standard.yaml)

This is the mzTab-M reference implementation and validation API service.

> **_NOTE:_**  This is an *early* development version, please use at your own risk and report issues to help improve it!

mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to share and combine basic information.

mzTab-M has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks:

1. Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results, especially with researchers outside the field of metabolomics.
2. Export of results to external software, including programs such as Microsoft ExcelÂ® and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R.
3. Act as an output format of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages.
4. Be able to link to the external experimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.

## Overview
This API client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By supplying the [mzTab-M Specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lifs-tools/jmzTab-m/master/api/src/main/resources/mzTab_m_swagger.yml), you can easily generate an API client, here for R:

```
docker run --rm \
    -v $PWD:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i /local/mzTab_m_swagger.yml \
    -g r \
    -o /local/out/r
```
The output in `out/r` builds the basis of this package.
Please note that for this implementation, the generated code was heavily modified.

## Installation
You'll need the `devtools` package in order to build the API.
Make sure you have a proper CRAN repository from which you can download packages.

### Prerequisites
Install the `devtools` package with the following command.
```R
if(!require(devtools)) { install.packages("devtools") }
```

### Installation of the API package
Make sure you set the working directory to where the API code is located.
Then execute
```R
library(devtools)
install(".")
```

To run the tests, execute
```R
library(devtools)
test()
```

This should be specified in Hill notation (EA Hill 1900), i.e. elements in the order C, H and then alphabetically all other elements. Counts of one may be omitted. Elements should be capitalized properly to avoid confusion (e.g., “CO” vs. “Co”). The chemical formula reported should refer to the neutral form.  Example: N-acetylglucosamine would be encoded by the string “C8H15NO6”.

The following CV terms are already available within the PSI MS CV. Future schemes may be implemented by extending the PSI MS CV with new terms and associated levels.  The MSI has recently discussed an extension of the original four level scheme into a five level scheme MS:1002896 (compound identification confidence level) with levels      isolated, pure compound, full stereochemistry (0)      reference standard match or full 2D structure (1)      unambiguous diagnostic evidence (literature, database) (2)      most likely structure, including isomers, substance class or substructure match (3)      unknown compound (4)  For high-resolution MS, the following term and its levels may be used: MS:1002955 (hr-ms compound identification confidence level) with levels      confirmed structure (1)      probable structure (2)          unambiguous ms library match (2a)          diagnostic evidence (2b)      tentative candidates (3)      unequivocal molecular formula (4)      exact mass (5)  A String data type is set to allow for different systems to be specified in the metadata section.
